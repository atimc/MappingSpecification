This file is an array of floats.
Each float is the height in meters of a coordinate in the map.
See header file spec for source of number of columns and rows.
In this example,  3612 each.

3612 * 3612 * sizeof(float) = 52,186,176.

This file is raw floats in Little Endian order.

Read each float in (52 mb) as the base of your map.

Each cell will be assigned 9 pixels with the center will for holder purposes
be a gray scale of the elevation between min and max elevations in this grid.
gray scale is measured from 0.0-1.0 so 
gray would be ( height - minheight ) / ( maxHeight-minHeight )

Each surrounding pixel will be colored according to slope of the land.
if slope is
%Slope
0-1       Light Green
1-2       Medium Green
2-3       Dark Green
3-4       Yellow
4-5       Ochre
5-6       Orange
6-7       Light red
7-8       red
8-9       Dark Red
9-10      lt Brown
10+       Dark Brown

if the slope is down, the color will be darkened with the Color.darken() call.


Water....
   Water will be identified as area 10 pixels or greater where 
   A : The slope is < .001 ( 1 tenth of 1% )
   B : any down hill is less then 5% of the circumference.
