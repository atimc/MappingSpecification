Number of Columns and Rows in the data....
ncols
nrows

Latitude and Longitude of Lower Left Corner. 
xllcorner = Longitude. ( negative is West... Positive is East of Greenwich )
yllcorner = Latitude.  ( Negative is south of Equator. Positive is north )

cellsize....   UNDONE This confuses me still, needs research.  Size between each pixel.?
                     This does not account for lessening size as you move north in longitude.
                    Some adjustment may be needed here.
                    What is known is..
                    cellsize * ncols = 1.003333334136 so this fits in as a possible size in degree of each pixel.(cell)
                    
                    
  NODATA_value is simply a cell where data was unavailable and it will hold this value.
  
  byteorder     Big Endian or Little Endian as the float is written on disk.
